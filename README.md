# This Project is a Todo-List app build using JavaScript to render the page.


> In this project, we built a `Todo-List` app following the [OdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) specification.<br>


## Project Description

The project is initialized by running `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev` to install webpack to the node_modules directory of your project.
A `src and dist` is created in the directory with the following contents:
- `index.js` file in src.
- `index.html` file in dist. 
- `main.js` is by generated by webpack when you run `npm run build`.
- A `webpack.config.js` is created to do the basic configurations.
- An HTML skeleton inside of `dist/index.html` file.


The `‚Äòtodos‚Äô` are objects dynamically created, using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.

### The Todo Has The Following Properties:

- It has projects or separate lists of todos. 
- When a user first opens the app, there is ‚Äòdefault‚Äô project to which all of their todos are put.  
- Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
- User should be able to view all projects.
- User should be able to view all todos in each project .
- User should be able to expand a single todo to see/edit its details
- User should be able to delete a todo

The application logic is modularize (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff.



`The project is hosted on gh-pages.`
